# Describing_projects

### 1. Covid 19 Tracker
#### This is a web app which i built using MEAN stack without any database.
#### In this i have used a free api from which i fetched the details of the covid cases and presented them in a tabular format where users can sort the table according to different parameters such as No. of cases, No. of people recovered, etc.
#### This app is deployed onto heroku server

### 2. Exam Notes
#### This is a web app built with MEAN stack and i have used Mongodb as a database.
#### In this web app users can upload their notes in pdf format and other users can view or can even download those files.
#### One of the challenge i faced during this project is how to manage different types of files such as pdf, doc, etc, but finally i managed to research about that on the internet and solved that issue.
#### App is deployed onto heroku server
